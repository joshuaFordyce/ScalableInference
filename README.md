Scalable Inference Server on Kubernetes
This project provides a robust, scalable, and automated solution for serving machine learning models for inference. It addresses the challenges of high-volume requests and latency by leveraging Kubernetes' native orchestration and autoscaling capabilities.

Key Features
Automated Scaling: The server automatically scales up and down based on demand, using a Kubernetes autoscaler.

Low Latency: The server is optimized for low-latency inference, using a model serving framework.

Kubernetes-Native: The server is deployed as a standard Kubernetes microservice, making it easy to manage and integrate with existing Kubernetes tools.

Observability: The server is designed to be easily monitored, with metrics exposed for an autoscaler and a monitoring stack.

CI/CD Integration: The project is designed to be easily integrated into a CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments.

Design & Architecture
Problem Statement
Serving a trained model for inference at scale is a complex task. You need to handle a high volume of requests, ensure low latency, and automatically scale the model based on demand. The traditional approach of manually scaling a microservice is inefficient and not scalable, which can lead to under-provisioned resources during traffic spikes or over-provisioned resources during idle periods, both of which are costly.

Solution Overview
The solution is a scalable inference server built on Kubernetes. The server is deployed as a microservice, and a model serving framework handles model loading and inference. The server is automatically scaled based on a metric like CPU utilization or request volume, ensuring that it can handle a high volume of concurrent requests with low latency.

High-Level Workflow
A client sends an API request to the server.

The request is received by a Kubernetes Ingress/Gateway, which routes the request to a Kubernetes Service.

The Service load balances the request to a healthy Pod that is running a model serving framework.

The Pod handles the request and sends a response back to the client.

An autoscaler (e.g., HPA or KEDA) watches metrics from the Pods and scales the number of Pods up or down based on demand, ensuring that the system is always appropriately provisioned for the current workload.
